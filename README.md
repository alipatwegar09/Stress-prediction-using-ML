# Stress-prediction-using-ML

#In this project i have used Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm to predict stress

#Bernoulli Naive Bayes is a part of the Naive Bayes family.
It is based on the Bernoulli Distribution and accepts only binary values, i.e., 0 or 1. If the features of the dataset are binary,
then we can assume that Bernoulli Naive Bayes is the algorithm to be used.

#Firstly we give input in textbox like person's condition like - "He is sad","I am happy"

#In above image [0] means it is a stress free .
